# Classifying-News-posts-embeddings-with-Keras
we will classify news articles using deep learning techniques by leveraging the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which consists of 18,000 newsgroup posts across 20 categories.
The task involves processing the data with Pandas, converting the text into embeddings, and then training a classification model using Keras. By using sampled subsets of the training and test sets, we will explore how embeddings and deep learning can be applied to text classification problems.

The project will include:

Data preprocessing with Pandas
Text embedding using Keras layers
Model training and evaluation with a neural network built in Keras
